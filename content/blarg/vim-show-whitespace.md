I like to be able to see the whitespace characters in my editor, specifically I like to see when code is indented with tabs versus spaces:

Add the following to your `.vimrc` to display a cute arrow unicode character for tabs in vim:

```vim
" Show extra whitespace
set listchars=tab:➪  
```

You can change the arrow to any valid unicode character that your chosen font supports. Play around and find something you really like.
