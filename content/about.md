## Software Development

I've worked with companies large and small; from *Google* and *Comcast*, 
to "mom-and-pop" shops and a lot in between. Every project presents unique challenges 
and opportunities to grow. *That's what keeps me excited about 
writing software*.

I primarily write web applications in Ruby on Rails but I also use Node.js, 
Golang and others if the need arises. I have years of experience in Ruby, Python,
JavaScript, CSS/Sass and many other web technologies.

## Other Things

In my spare time I spend a lot of time in the outdoors hiking, 
camping, running and exploring.

I studied fine arts in college (painting and photography) and have a 
passion for creating things with my hands.

In early 2012, I started a project to create the *first arts and maker space in 
Sonoma County* and am happy to say that it is alive and well. 
We regularly host classes, events and meetups and our membership is growing rapidly.
