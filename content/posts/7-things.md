## A Little Background

It's the new year and I've finally committed to writing a post about my experiences as the founder of a makerspace.

Part of my apprehension stemmed from the fact that our organization, [Chimera Art Space][chimera], is still in it's infancy. In fact, we only just opened for membership about a two months ago.

Even though we're young, *there has been quite a lot of learning we've gone through in the process of getting here* and some of that may be helpful to others who'd like to start their own makerspace.

Over the past year we've hosted dozens of meetups, attended multiple fairs and events and have taught classes on 3D printing, jewelry and more.

Below I'll outline some key takeaways from my experience so far getting a makerspace off the ground. Your mileage may vary!


## 1. Don't Do It Alone

If you're going to take the long, hard journey of starting a makerspace, *you shouldn't undertake it alone*. 

Starting a makerspace takes years of work and thousands of hours of shedding blood, sweat and tears. There will be up and downs, successes and failures and it's important to have people you like and trust joining you on the journey. They're the people that will keep you going when you want to quit. They'll be the ones that make the journey worth while.

It's important to share this journey with people that share your vision and that are willing to support the cause with both their time and money. 

A lot of people are attracted to the idea of a makerspace and are more than happy to voice their excitement. However, only a small percentage of those people will truly commit to helping in a serious way.


## 2. Start Small, Grow Slowly

Once you've established a small, core team you should take the path towards starting slowly and methodically. Start by having regular meetups with interested people.

When we first started, we hosted "Hack Nights" at our company office where we encouraged people to bring projects they're working on and ideas they have. These nights were very successful and started to establish who were the people that were serious about seeing something like this happen.

One of our big mistakes early on was being overly ambitious about what we could accomplish with the time and energy we had. It took us nearly a year to realize that we were over extended and beginning to burn. What we didn't realize was that we were bringing it all on ourselves. 

Starting a makerspace takes a lot more time and energy then you first realized. In order to stay 

- Don't prematurely optimize
- Think about [what business model you want](http://contextly.com/redirect/?id=nwY3K0A2CV:337586:247:)


## 3. Say No, A Lot

You'll soon find that there are more ideas and opportunities than you can reasonable take advantage of and *if you want to keep your sanity you'll have to learn when to say no*.

I've made the mistake of overextending myself many times and risked burning out each time I did. If there would be a cool fair or event we were invited to go to, I'd always say yes even though they were energetically draining and really weren't what were top priority for us to focus on.

In order to feel confident when you tell people no, you need to know what your priorities are and to be reasonable with your estimate of your available time and energy. 

Know that *there will always be more opportunities in the future*, you've just got to focus on the important ones right now.


## 4. Beware of Naysayers

*There will always be people who think you're doing everything wrong*. While you should hear these people out and take any of their valid criticism to heart, it's important to not let them weigh you down too much. 

I've found that the people that are the most negative and combative personalities often are not aware of how they're behaving. They also tend to be the people that put in the least amount of work in helping the organization succeed. 


## 5. Talk to Other Spaces

There are a growing list of successful makerspaces out there with a myriad of business models, missions and communities. *Reach out to a wide variety of them and learn everything you can*.

I personally have interviewed at least a dozen founders and plan on talking with many more in the future. Each conversation is enlightening and adds something to my understanding of what makes a successful space.

Some questions you could ask are:

- What are the top 3 biggest mistakes you've made?
- What has been the most successful community building tool for your group?
- Why did you start your space?

Make sure to *learn from other people's successes and mistakes as much as possible*. Don't be afraid to ask.

## 6. Setup A Maintainable Foundation

The foundation you set early on while have a huge impact on the outcome of your venture.

Some other ideas that we've implemented at Chimera:

- *Have a website that answers common questions* so that you can direct people to the site rather than answering the same email over and over again. See [our site][chimera] for some ideas. 
- *Make members be responsible for training new members*. If someone is interested in joining, have them *reach out to existing members and find a sponsor*. Their sponsor will be responsible for signing them up and training them. In addition, if the member becomes a problem in the organization, their sponsor is responsible.
- *Have members take responsibility for donated equipment*. If they want to see a piece of equipment at the space, they should be the point person responsible for making sure it is running and not collecting dust. This is especially important in the early days of an organization as you probably won't have paid staff that can do this instead.


## 7. Most Importantly: Have Fun!

**If you're not having fun and you're not getting paid, you will get burnt out**; it's just a matter of time. Prevent burnout by making sure you're doing things that you personally enjoy in addition to serving the needs of others.
